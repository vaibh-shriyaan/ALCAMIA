# ALCAMIA

I have implemented the following as per the guidelines--

UI Related Requirements:
✅In the header, clicking on the search icon should open a search box (design on the right side in Figma).

✅On the product section (where it says Alcami Elements) the gallery on the left should be functional. Clicking on the arrows or dots should change the image. Also clicking on the thumbnails should change the image also.

✅On the percentage section ( where it has those 84%, 78% things ), the numbers should count up from 0 when the user reaches the section.

✅The table should be a HTML table.

✅The testimonial section should be scrollable.

✅In the FAQ section, FAQs should be openable accordions.

✅Use CSS animations where applicable for a smoother UI experience.

✅Implement lazy loading for images.

✅Hosting: The page is deployed on Netlify.
The link is shared in the submission form.
